   - Database design and management
   - User interface development

2. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Apply supervised learning for expense categorization
   - Implement unsupervised learning for pattern recognition
   - Use ensemble methods for improved accuracy

3. **Deep Learning Applications**
   - Implement LSTM networks for time series forecasting
   - Use neural networks for complex pattern recognition
